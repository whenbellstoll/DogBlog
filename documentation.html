            <p class="documentation">The API we used was random.dog. There's no easter eggs of any kind, but we did put a lot of potential blog posts in (around 40), if you want to see them all you can just check the big array in the js file.</p>
            <p class="documentation">Our project is essentially a database for blogs written by dogs - we use our API to pull a dog image.  We give each entry a unique ID, so you can look up the same name, interest and age later and it will pull up the same dog - so it not only saves the last term searched, but every term searched.  If the user refreshes, it will assign the name/interest/age last used automatically to the page. We have a variety of potential blogs to pull from, along with random dates to assign it to. We used original CSS, and the website is pretty simple to understand.</p>
            <p class="documentation">Overall, we feel a fair grade is a 90 or a 95.</p>            
            <p class="documentation">Kent was the lead man on the coding and the architecture for the project. Additionally, he made the post-milestone 1 design choices for the CSS.</p>
            <p class="documentation">Drake did the initial design and concept, came up with blog posts and assisted with coding and planning the project.</p>
